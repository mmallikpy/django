# üí° **What is "User Registration Flow"?**

It is the **full process** a new user follows to create an account on your website or app.

---

# ‚úÖ **Basic steps in a typical user registration flow**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ User opens registration form

* The user sees fields like:

  * Username
  * Email
  * Password (and confirm password)
  * Optional: first name, last name, etc.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ User submits form

* User fills in details and clicks "Sign Up" or "Register".

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Server validates data

* Check if:

  * Username or email already exists.
  * Password is strong enough.
  * Both passwords match.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Save user

* If valid:

  * Create a new user object in the database.
  * By default, you can set `is_active = True`.
  * ‚úÖ **OR**, if using email verification, you set `is_active = False` (wait for them to verify).

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Send verification email (optional but recommended)

* Send an email with an **activation link** to confirm their email address.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ User verifies email (if used)

* User clicks link.
* Server verifies token.
* Sets `is_active = True`.
* User account becomes fully active.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Login automatically or ask to login

* After activation, you can:

  * Auto-login the user and redirect to dashboard.
  * OR, ask them to log in manually.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Show success message / redirect

* Show "Registration successful" message.
* Redirect to dashboard or login page.

---

# ‚úÖ **In Django (summary)**

* Use `UserCreationForm` or custom form.
* Validate and save user.
* Optionally set `is_active = False`.
* Send verification email using `EmailMultiAlternatives`.
* Handle activation link view.
* Redirect and show success.

---

## ‚≠ê **Extra security features you can add**

* CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA (to block bots).
* Stronger password policies.
* Email or phone verification.
* Welcome email after activation.
